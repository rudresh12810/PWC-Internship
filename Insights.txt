Recommendations
• To increase revenue, there should be an emphasis to push a customer from a month to month contract and instead sign up for 1 or 2 year contract. • We should seek to improve advertising or value of Online Security to early customers. Churners often decline Online Security in their early tenure.
• There is an issue with Electronic checks we need to address because there is a tremendous loss in revenue.
• There should be an emphasis to prevent Admin tickets from occurring to new customers because it can result in higher churn rates.
• Discounts should be encouraged to keep current customers from churning.
